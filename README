video_diff
==============

Videodiff is a python script that lets you calculate the difference between frames of a video and output the results as a csv file.

The csv file is arranged as 
timestamp of the frame, percentage difference 
(timestamp in seconds), (decimal 2.16 is 2.16% difference in raw pixels)

Not all frames can be processed so in a 30 fps movie, only 5 frames may be whole frames and can therefore be compared.

Installation
============

You will need the Python OpenCV Bindings installed. Please see the OpenCV wiki for details.

Example
=======

python example.py videofile.mov videofile.csv -w -v -d -c
